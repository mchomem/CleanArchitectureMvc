# Clean Architecture with Mvc

This repository contains a simple and functional application model for managing products and categories (of products).
This project is the result of the course [Clean Architecture Essencial - ASP .NET Core com C#](https://www.udemy.com/course/clean-architecture-essencial-asp-net-core-com-c/?kw=clean+architecture+com&src=sac&couponCode=ST6MT42324) created by [Jose Carlos Macoratti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jose-macoratti-2507156a/).

In this course, in addition to studying the clean architecture approach implemented in an ASP.NET MVC type application with Razor pages, features such as security, CQRS, repository pattern and many others are covered.
As usual, I always modify some details of the project to go a little further than proposed, this project is not simply typing the code and compiling, much less copying and pasting.
Small improvements have been made to both the frontend and backend.
